Package Overview
This package allows users to go from a hapmap file (.hmp.txt) to STRUCTURE, and also to interpret the STRUCTURE output using graphs and filtering parameters.
It also include functions to write the scripts needed to run STRUCTURE on HPCCs.

Function Shortlist

Dependencies: Lindsay's hapMap2numeric function and numeric2structure function (https://github.com/lvclark/R_genetics_conv)
-Function to generate mainparams and extraparams file
-Function to write bash scripts that run structure on HPCCs

-Function to define S3 class for Structure results and import the results (i.e. individual ancestry frequencies and allelewise ancestry frequencies)
-If possible: function to average ancestry estimates across runs of structure (replications) which can detect which column contains which population
-Function to generate bar graphs for Structure results, including options to order by Q or use custom ordering
-Function to filter the allelewise ancestry frequencies into sets which meet a given threshold of ancestry in a given
-Function to get a vector of individual names which meet a given threshold of ancestry in group n (e.g. individuals less than 10% admixed)
-If we have time: function to map pie charts of structure results by latitude and longitude (dependency: raster)
