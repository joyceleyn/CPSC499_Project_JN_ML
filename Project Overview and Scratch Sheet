Function Shortlist

Dependencies: Lindsay's hapMap2numeric function and numeric2structure function (https://github.com/lvclark/R_genetics_conv)
-Function to generate mainparams and extraparams file
-Function to write bash scripts that run structure on HPCCs

-Function to define S3 class for Structure results and import the results (i.e. individual ancestry frequencies and allelewise ancestry frequencies)
-If possible: function to average ancestry estimates across runs of structure (replications) which can detect which column contains which population
-Function to generate bar graphs for Structure results, including options to order by Q or use custom ordering
-If we have time: function to map pie charts of structure results by latitude and longitude (dependency: raster)
-Function to filter the allelewise ancestry frequencies into sets which meet a given threshold of ancestry in group n
-Function to get a vector of individual names which meet a given threshold of ancestry in group n (e.g. individuals less than 10% admixed)
